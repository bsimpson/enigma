I became interested in how the Engima machine works so I've started to replicate some of its key components after watching a few videos:

These detail how the enigma machine had three wheels that were connected so that when each turned over it would increment the wheel to its left (imilar to an odometer).

Much more still to implement

Usage:

```
  enigma = Enigma.new
  enigma.increment!
```
